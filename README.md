# 🏗️ PyLaTeX-Beam-Analysis-Automator

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based automation tool designed to generate comprehensive, submission-ready engineering reports for **Simply Supported Beams**. 

By processing loading data from Excel, the script performs structural calculations and leverages **PyLaTeX** to typeset a professional PDF. Unlike standard reporting tools, this script generates **native LaTeX vector graphics**, ensuring that diagrams remain perfectly sharp at any scale.

## ✨ Features
* **✅ Automated Data Processing:** Reads point loads and beam geometry from Excel using `pandas`.
* **✅ Native LaTeX Tables:** Reconstructs force data into searchable, professional `tabular` environments.
* **✅ TikZ/pgfplots Vector Diagrams:** Programmatically generates **Shear Force Diagrams (SFD)** and **Bending Moment Diagrams (BMD)** using TikZ—no low-resolution images.
* **✅ Structured Documentation:** Includes a Title Page, Table of Contents, Introduction with embedded beam diagrams, and a detailed Analysis section.
* **✅ Professional Aesthetics:** Mimics industrial software outputs (like Midas) with shaded contour plots and axis legends.
