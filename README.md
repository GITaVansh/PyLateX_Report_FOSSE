# 📊 Structural Beam Analysis Report Generator

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an automated Python-based solution designed to generate professional engineering reports for **Simply Supported Beams**. By bridging the gap between data analysis and professional typesetting, the script reads loading data from Excel and produces a high-fidelity PDF report using **PyLaTeX**.

The tool is specifically designed to meet structural engineering standards, featuring vector-based diagrams that remain crisp at any zoom level.

## ✨ Features
* **✅ Automated Data Ingestion:** Uses `pandas` to extract loading points and magnitudes from Excel spreadsheets.
* **✅ Native LaTeX Tabulars:** Reconstructs the force table as selectable, searchable LaTeX text (no image-based tables).
* **✅ TikZ/pgfplots Diagrams:** Generates vector-based **Shear Force Diagrams (SFD)** and **Bending Moment Diagrams (BMD)** directly in the PDF.
* **✅ Professional Formatting:** Automatically generates a Title Page, Table of Contents, and structured sections for Introduction, Analysis, and Summary.
* **✅ Visual Integration:** Embeds reference beam diagrams within the analysis section using PyLaTeX Figure environments.
